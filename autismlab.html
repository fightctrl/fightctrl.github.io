                <p>Murdoch University’s Cognition in Autism lab carries out research to understand how kids, teens and adults think, hear and communicate to ultimately improve learning and life outcomes for autistic and non-autistic&nbsp;individuals.</p>

                <h3 class="mc-subheading">RBROADENING PEOPLE’S UNDERSTANDING OF AUTISM</h3>
                <p>Sadly, there is a still a lack of understanding about autism spectrum disorder (ASD) amongst the wider public due to ignorance and misinformation. And when reputable resources can be found, they are often found on websites that aren’t designed to accommodate to autistic&nbsp;individuals.</p>
                <p>The Cognition in Autism lab aims to co-design research studies with stakeholders, provide new, trustworthy findings and resources to the ASD community by creating a website that is ASD-friendly to help raise awareness, educate and improve the quality of life for both autistic and non-autistic&nbsp;individuals.</p>

                <h3 class="mc-subheading">CAPTURING THE LAB’S VALUES</h3>
                <p>When starting on this project, the lab did not have an established brand identity which made designing a trustworthy website&nbsp;challenging.</p>
                <p>Because of this, I created moodboards that captured the essence of the organisation to better understand how to present the organisation as trusting and community-focused to the ASD&nbsp;community.</p>

                <h3 class="mc-subheading">BUILDING TRUST THROUGH FAMILIARITY</h3>
                <p>Using the moodboards I created as a guide, I sketched out different ideas and created rough concepts of three ideas—a brain, an infinity symbol and a handprint—that embodied the organisation’s values of creativity, empowerment and&nbsp;community.</p>
                <p>The brain is often used to represent neurodivergency. Handprints often convey creativity and humanity. And the infinity symbol, particularly the rainbow infinity symbol, is already used to represent the autistic rights&nbsp;movement.</p>
                <p>By using symbols that are already embedded with meaning, it shows that the lab is approachable, and by extension, shows that ASD is something that can be easily&nbsp;understood.</p>

            <div class="col-md-4 mc-order-2">
                <h3 class="mc-subheading">DESIGNING WITH THE CLIENT</h3>
                <p>The clients chose to go with the brain concept I presented as they felt that it would make the lab look professional and reputable. They didn’t go with the infinity concept as that symbol is quite contentious amongst the ASD community and wanted to avoid&nbsp;that.</p>
                <p>Initially, the clients did think the brain concepts looked like a speech bubble as I intentionally made it abstract to show that ASD isn’t easily defined. So I worked on cleaning it up to avoid misinterpretation, especially since presenting things clearly is more&nbsp;ASD-friendly.</p>

                <h3 class="mc-subheading">CREATING AN APPROACHABLE SITE</h3>
                <p>Accessibility was the main priority so I made sure to create an ASD-friendly design by using white space, warm desaturated colours, legible type and static imagery. The simple and clean layout also makes people more likely to trust the website as information can be found&nbsp;easily.</p>

                <h3 class="mc-subheading">EVALUATING THE PROJECT</h3>
                <p>Because I was brought onto this project for a limited time, I was unable to interview or test the website on autistic individuals to make sure that the design accommodates their&nbsp;needs.</p>
                <p class="mc-padding-bottom">The next steps would be to conduct user testing to ensure that the website is accessible for autistic users and includes content that addresses the audience’s&nbsp;needs.</p>
