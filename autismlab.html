            <p>Murdoch University’s Cognition in Autism Research Lab carries out research to understand how kids, teens and adults think, hear and communicate to ultimately improve learning and life outcomes for autistic and non-autistic individuals. To achieve this, a brand identity and website accommodated towards autistic individuals were created to provide reputable resources and educate the wider public on autism spectrum disorder&nbsp;(ASD).</p>

        <div class="col-md-8">
            <p>Cognition in Autism Research Lab needed to feel trustworthy and friendly towards individuals with ASD. The branding achieves this sense of community and friendliness through the use of warm colours, a balanced typeface and a recurring handprint motif while also being mindful of not overly stimulating autistic&nbsp;individuals.</p>
            <p>In the same visual style as the handprint motif, the lab's logo is that of a brain. The brain is often used to represent neurodivergence. By using familiar iconography that is already embedded with meaning, it shows that the lab is approachable, and by extension, shows that ASD is something that can be easily understood. Its simple and clear presentation also lends itself to making the lab look professional and&nbsp;reputable.</p>

        <div class="col-md-8">
            <p>With accessibility being the main priority, an ASD-friendly design was created by using white space, warm desaturated colours, legible type and static imagery all in accordance to web accessibility standards. The simple and clean layout of the home page makes people more likely to trust the website as information can be found easily. Additionally, the use of the handprint motifs act as a visual guide to lead people's gaze down the home&nbsp;page.</p>

            <p>Considering what I was able to achieve and accomplish within the limited timeframe I was working with the lab, I'm proud that I was able to create a logo and develop a WordPress website that the clients were happy with. And since establishing the lab's visual identity, the Cognition in Autism Research Lab has consistently used and applied it in their communication and reserach material. They have also started using the website to share the lab's&nbsp;findings.</p>
