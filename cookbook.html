            <p><em>Have You Eaten Yet?</em> is a personal cookbook of family recipes. As someone whose to connection to culture and heritage isn't that strong, food has been the only thing that's stuck with me. This cookbook is my way of recording my family's recipes to prevent it from being lost and strengthen my cultural ties. It contains recipes of traditional dishes my parents grew up eating in Malaysia and simple home-cooked meals we've eaten together as a&nbsp;family.</p>

            <p>There needed to be a visual link to Malaysian culture in the cookbook as it contains both traditional and non-traditional dishes. Taking inspiration from my family's hometown, George Town, Penang, vibrant colours and tile patterns are used to further cement the cookbook's cultural&nbsp;identity.</p>
            <p>The use of different typefaces serve the purpose of ensuring that the recipes are easy to read and making the anecdotes look&nbsp;personal.</p>

            <p>Creating this cookbook was quite the family activity with how involved everyone was. I didn’t realise just how important food was to us until I started working on this&nbsp;project.</p>
            <p>Even though I barely cook, this cookbook is something I’ll keep using when I’m in need of something familiar. There is also the possibility of adding more recipes as this cookbook is not a comprehensive&nbsp;collection.</p>
