                <h3 class="mc-subheading">THE PROJECT</h3>
                <p>The Australian Academy of Science is a not-for-profit organisation that aims to inform, build trust and promote engagement on scientific matters within the&nbsp;community.</p>
                <p>This waste and waterways campaign is a hypothetical campaign aiming to instill the belief that anyone can make a difference to the amount of waste along Australia's&nbsp;waterways.</p>

                <h3 class="mc-subheading">INSTILLING GOOD WASTE PRACTICES EARLY</h3>
                <p>Australia generates more waste and recycles less than other developed countries. Factors like lack of incentive and social embarrassment among adults has contributed to tonnes of plastic and other waste entering our&nbsp;waterways.</p>
                <p>Rather than target adults, I chose to create an anti-littering campaign to effectively engage young children (aged 3–10) in adopting good waste practices due to their eagerness to be&nbsp;proactive.</p>

                <h3 class="mc-subheading">NARROWING THE FOCUS</h3>
                <p>I looked into peer-reviewed research studies into current waste practices. From that, I found that adults were reluctant to change their behaviour due to lack of incentive or social embarrassment despite having an awareness of the impact of waste pollution has on waterways. This meant that the challenge of this campaign was bridging the gap between people's attitudes and&nbsp;behaviours.</p>
                <p>This led me to shift the focus onto young children as they were found to be more likely to adopt and retain good waste practices after being taught preventative measures. Targeting children also has the added potential of impacting their family and friends as children who engage in repeated actions are capable of influencing others to adopt those same&nbsp;actions.</p>
                <p>Having defined the audience, litter prevention was chosen as the focus because it has been found to lead to higher waste reduction. Children also have a high perception of litter being the cause of waste in waterways. By focusing on something that children already know, the message is able to target primarily on behaviours, rather than&nbsp;attitudes.</p>

                <h3 class="mc-subheading">DECIDING PERSUASIVE TACTICS</h3>
                <p>Having analysed previous waste management campaigns, I found that they often use the threat of shame and embarrassment in their messaging or shocking imagery of wildlife to urge people to litter less or use less&nbsp;plastics.</p>
                <p>Most of these tactics would not be effective on children, so I decided to not over complicate the design and the message of the campaign and keep it&nbsp;simple.</p>
                <p>I chose to implement wildlife imagery, a turtle, as it would be an element engaging to children. Positive messaging was also used as it would reinforce and validate good behaviour. I also ame sure to make the slogan rhyme to make this campaign memorable to&nbsp;children.</p>

                <ul class="mc-list">
                    <li>Strategically place the posters and prints in locations that are commonly frequented by children and are prone to&nbsp;litter.</li>
                    <li>Implementing the campaign into these locations’ wayfinding systems to direct children to the nearest&nbsp;bin.</li>
                    <li>Integrating the campaign into educational programs in&nbsp;schools.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="mc-subheading">EVALUATING THE PROJECT</h3>
                <p>This project could be further expanded into an interconnected series of posters and related outputs focusing on other waste management strategies. There is also the opportunity in assisting government and corporations with restructuring current waste management systems to align with the project’s goal of reducing waste in&nbsp;waterways.</p>
