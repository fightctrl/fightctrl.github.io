                <h3 class="mc-subheading">THE PROJECT</h3>
                <p>The Fremantle Arts Centre (FAC) is home to a variety of arts courses, events and exhibitions as well as a rich heritage dating as far back as the&nbsp;1860s.</p>
                <p>The Concert Series is a hypothetical service offering that focuses solely on FAC’s live music events in an effort to encourage music enthusiasts and locals to support the live music scene in&nbsp;Fremantle.</p>

                <h3 class="mc-subheading">OPTIMISING THE CONCERT EXPERIENCE</h3>
                <p>The FAC’s most popular offerings are its live music events. For their target audience mostly interested in live music, the FAC website is currently not suited for finding out the upcoming performing artists as the website also promotes art exhibitions, courses and other non-music&nbsp;events.</p>
                <p>A dedicated online space focused on FAC’s live music events was developed to optimise people’s, particularly FAC’s music-loving target audience, concert experience before they even attend a FAC concert in&nbsp;person.</p>

                <h3 class="mc-subheading">UNDERSTANDING THE AUDIENCE</h3>
                <p>I conducted design sprints to fully understand the target audience’s needs. This involved creating personas of FAC’s target audience, empathy mapping, journey mapping and point of view and how might we&nbsp;statements.</p>
                <p>The design sprints helped identify the need to highlight FAC’s unique selling point, which is its heritage, and making information about events and featured artists streamlined to engage and cater to the target&nbsp;audience.</p>

                <h3 class="mc-subheading">CREATING A DISTINCT LOOK</h3>
                <p>The main challenge of this project was incorporating the history and heritage of FAC whilst still being engaging to attract music enthusiasts and&nbsp;locals.</p>
                <p>I decided to play around with different logo designs to help define the visual direction of this project as logos are a great way of succinctly communicating a project’s&nbsp;identity.</p>

                <h3 class="mc-subheading">GETTING THE AUDIENCE'S ATTENTION</h3>
                <p>The content layout of the home page was informed by my design sprints where audiences have expressed events and event information as the most important information they actively seek&nbsp;out.</p>
                <p>I also made sure to factor in the organisation’s own goals and added information and call to actions to encourage audiences to further engage with&nbsp;FAC.</p>
                <p>I managed to combine the conflicting historical and contemporary aesthetics by mimicking shapes commonly found in Fremantle’s historical architecture and using bright colours against a dark background to replicate concert&nbsp;lighting.</p>

                <h3 class="mc-subheading">ENSURING USABILITY</h3>
                <p>After coding the website, I conducted user testing to make sure that the website was functional for users and communicated its connection to live music and Fremantle’s heritage to&nbsp;audiences.</p>
                <p>From this testing, several changes were made, like adding visual cues and change the size of elements, to lessen the difficulty of certain website&nbsp;tasks.</p>

                <p>This project could help FAC get more engagement by collaborating with local musicians and community groups in Fremantle and Western Australia. People’s experience with FAC’s live music events could also be further optimised by implementing findings from this project into different spaces like social&nbsp;media.</p>
