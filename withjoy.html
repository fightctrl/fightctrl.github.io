            <p>With Joy is a conceptual dental care brand that seeks to minimise the impact of dental waste. The dental industry contributes a huge amount of waste due to the standard use of short-lived plastic and nylon products. As a response to these practices, With Joy aims to help consumers lesser their harmful impact by creating packaging and products that are safe for the environment and shifts people's understanding of quality dental&nbsp;care.</p>

            <p>With Joy's visual identity really leans into its values of sustainability and consumer care through the use of cool green hues, contemporary typefaces and simple graphics. These components also visually distinguishes With Joy from other dental care&nbsp;brands.</p>
            <p>The logo resembles a smile through the curve of the brand's name to communicate With Joy's dental connection. It is embellished with a twinkle to convey&nbsp;cleanliness.</p>

        <div class="col-md-8">
            <p>The catalyst of this entire project was thinking about how floss should be packaged in paper boxes rather the usual plastic containers. From there, the product line expanded to include toothpaste and&nbsp;mouthwash.</p>
            <p>A distinct feature of these product packages are the instructional icons. Other brands tend to include written instructions in a tiny font next to other bits of information. These icons not only make it easier for consumers to find the instructions but also visualise each instructional&nbsp;step.</p>

            <p>This brand identity could be further expanded to include other touchpoints like a website or a community initative to better increase brand visibility and educate people on sustainable oral&nbsp;hygiene.</p>
