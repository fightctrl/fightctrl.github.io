            <p>The website's look and feel needed to communicate that the client's business is trustworthy and is capable of helping people on their journey to long-lasting health ownership. The use of cool and calm colours most commonly associated with nature provides a sense of escapism from the burdens of work. The use of a contemporary antique slab serif typeface gives the website a sense of familiarity and trustworthiness due to its classic and timeless&nbsp;look.</p>
            <p>Dandelions are used as a motif as they represent growth and healing, further reinforcing the business's health&nbsp;values.</p>

            <p>I like designing with clients and getting them involved with projects and this one was no different. The development of the website, from the initial wireframes and design comps to the actual coding, involved a lot of communication and collaboration with the client to ensure that the final result was something she was happy&nbsp;with.</p>
